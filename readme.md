> Shell script to download Google Chrome without Safari

This is a shell script to download Google Chrome without using Safari.

Currently, only macOS is supported.

This script will determine if your PC is equipped with an Intel chip or Apple Silicon and download the appropriate `.dmg` installer file.

Browsers other than Chrome (e.g. Firefox, Edge, Vivaldi, Opera) do not provide static direct download links and are not supported at this time.
